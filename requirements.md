# Calculus Made Simple!

The webpages must be able to navigate to one another.

1. Homepage (4 options to pick from)
2. Def int (buttons to go to other modes)
3. Indef int (buttons to go to other modes)
4. Derivative at point (buttons to go to other modes)
5. Indef derivative (buttons to go to other modes)

Multivariable functionality will be added implicitly (when the variable is being asked for)

We should make sure there is room for plots for atleast 3 out of 4 of the web pages.
